### Notes
I implemented a pop up for each movie that displays the movie review and rating. When implementing this component I had to think of creative ways of optaining the position of the movie that was clicked as well as the context in which I wanted the pop up to show. I also had trouble finding the right place to make an api GET request to obtain the review for each specific movie. After a lot of research and experimentation, I was able to implement it flawlessly!
